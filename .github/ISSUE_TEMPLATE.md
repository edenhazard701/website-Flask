**This issue tracker is a tool to address bugs and feature requests in
Flask-SQLAlchemy itself. Please use the [#pocoo IRC channel on freenode](http://flask.pocoo.org/community/irc/)
or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flask-sqlalchemy?sort=linked) for general questions about using Flask-SQLAlchemy
or issues not related to Flask-SQLAlchemy.**

If you'd like to report a issue in Flask-SQLAlchemy, fill out the template below.
Provide any extra information that may be useful / related to your problem.
Ideally, create a [minimal, complete, and verifiable example (MCVE)](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve),
which helps us understand the problem and helps check that it is not caused
by something in your code.

Flask-SQLAlchemy is a thin wrapper that combines [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) and [SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy). Please
make sure your issue is **actually with Flask-SQLAlchemy and not SQLAlchemy** before
submitting. Consider checking the traceback to see if the error is coming from SQLAlchemy,
or checking if your issue has already been reported as a [SQLAlchemy issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues).

Also, please be kind - this project is maintained by volunteers. We appreciate
you taking the time to provide the information needed to address your issue.
